== External Services ==
This plugin integrates with the Cloudflare Turnstile CAPTCHA service to help protect WordPress forms from spam and automated abuse.

When a protected form (such as login, registration, or comment) is displayed, the plugin connects to Cloudflare Turnstile to generate a CAPTCHA challenge. When the form is submitted, Turnstile receives the user's IP address and browser metadata to verify whether the submission is from a human or bot.
